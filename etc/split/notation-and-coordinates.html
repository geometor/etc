<h3>NOTATION AND COORDINATES</h3>

<p class="auto-style2">The reference triangle is ABC, with sidelengths a,b,c. Each triangle
center P has homogeneous trilinear coordinates, or simply <a href="../tcenters/trilin.html" class="bold">trilinears</a>, of the form x : y : z. This means that there is a nonzero function h of (a,b,c) such that
</p>
<p>
x = hx', y = hy', z = hz',
<br>
 <p class="auto-style2">where x', y', z' denote the directed distances from P to sidelines BC, CA, AB. Likewise, u : v : w are <b>barycentrics</b> if there is a function k of (a,b,c) such that
</p>
<p>
u = ku', v = kv', w = kw',
<br>
<p class="auto-style2">where u', v', w' denote the signed areas of triangles PBC, PCA, PAB.  Both coordinate systems are widely used; if trilinears for a point are x : y : z, then barycentrics are ax : by : cz.

In order that every center should have its own name, in cases where no particular name arises from geometrical or historical considerations, the name of a star is used instead. For example, X(770) is POINT ACAMAR. For a list of star names, visit <a href="http://www.obliquity.com/skyeye/misc/name.html">SkyEye - (Un)Common Star Names</a>.
