The Vijay 1st parallel transform of U is the isogonal conjugate of the Vu tangential transform of U, and the perspector of ABC and the reflection of the cevian triangle of U in the centroid of ABCU.  It is also the anticomplement of the centroid of {{[complement of U], [vertices of anticevain triangle of complement of U]}}, and also the isogonal conjugate of the TCC-perspector of [isogonal conjugate of complement of U].
