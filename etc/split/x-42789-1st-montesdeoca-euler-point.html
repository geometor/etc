The mapping x(3) + t x(4)  8 t SA SB SC X(3) + a^2 b^2 c^2 X(4) is an involution of the Euler line. The mapping includes {X(3), X(4)} and {X(1113), X(1114)} as involutory pairs.  The fixed points of the mapping are

These points are real if and only if the reference triangle ABC is acute.  (Angel Montesdeoca, April 26, 2021.)  The points are here named the <b>1st Montesdeoca-Euler point</b> and <b>2nd Montesdeoca-Euler point</b>, respectively.
