Let A' be the pole of the Gergonne line wrt the circle with BC as diameter, and define B', C' cyclically.  X(1699) is the centroid of A'B'C'. (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)

<p>
Let A' be the orthocenter of BCX(1), and define B' and C' cyclically.  A'B'C' is also the anticevian triangle, wrt intouch triangle, of X(1), and X(1699) is the centroid of A'B'C'; see also X(3680). (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)

X(1699) is the centroid of triangle formed by reflecting vertices of 1st circumperp triangle in corresponding side of ABC.  (If 2nd circumperp triangle is substituted, for 1st, the resulting triangle is the Fuhrmann triangle.) (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)

Let A'B'C' be the orthic triangle.  Let A" be the A-excenter of AB'C', and define B" and C" cyclically.  The centroid of triangle A"B"C" is X(1699). (Randy Hutson, July 31 2018)
