<h3 id="X531">X(531) = DIRECTION OF VECTOR AX + BX + CX, where X = X(14)</h3>
Trilinears    (2ax - by - cz)/a : : where x = x(A,B,C) = csc(A - &pi;/3), y = x(B,C,A), z = x(C,A,B)

Let A' be the nine-point center of BCX(13), and define B' and C' cyclically.  A'B'C' is an equilateral triangle concyclic with X(2) and X(13) (inscribed in the 1st Hutson circle).           The isogonal (and isotomic) conjugate of X(2) wrt A'B'C' is X(531).  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)
