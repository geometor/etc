X(76) is the vertex conjugate of the foci of the inellipse that is the barycentric square of the de Longchamps line.  The center of the inellipse is X(626) and its Brianchon point (perspector) is X(1502).  (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)

Let A'B'C' be the obverse triangle of X(1).  Let A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; be the N-obverse triangle of X(1).  Let A* be the barycentric product A'*A&Prime;, and define B* and C* cyclically.  The lines AA*, BB*, CC* concur in X(76).  (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)
