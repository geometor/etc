X(6) is the point of concurrence of the symmedians (i.e., reflections of medians in corresponding angle bisectors). X(6) is the point which, when given by <i>actual</i> trilinear distances x,y,z, minimizes x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>.

Let A'B'C' be the pedal triangle of an arbitrary point X, and let S(X) be the vector sum XA' + XB' + XC'. Then
</p>
<p>
S(X) = (0 vector) if and only if X = X(6).
</p>
<p>
The "if" implication is equivalent to the well known fact that X(6) is the centroid of its pedal triangle, and the converse was proved by Barry Wolk (Hyacinthos #19, Dec. 23, 1999).

(1) If X = X(k) for k = 3, 6, 15, 16, 61, 62, then the locus of X'<sub>T</sub> is a conic.
<br>
(2) If X = X(15) or X = X(16), the conic is a circle.
<br>
(3) If P is one of the points X(k), for k = 3, 6, 15, 16, 61, 62, then the locus of X'<sub>T</sub>
is a single point, and the points O, X<sub>T</sub>, X'<sub>T</sub> are collinear.  For example, if P = X(6), then the locus of X(6)-of-T' is collinear with O and X(6)-of-T.

Let &Gamma; denote the circumcircle. The trilinear polar of every point on &Gamma; passes through X(6); conversely, the trilinear pole of every line through X(6) lies on &Gamma;. The trilinear polar of every point on the Lemoine axis (the polar of X(6) with respect to &Gamma;) is a line tangent to the Brocard inellipse; conversely, the trilinear pole of every line tangent to the Brocard inellipse lies on the Lemoine axis.

Let P be a point in the plane of T = ABC, and let T'=A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of P. Let A'' = BC&cap;B'C', and define B'' and C'' cycllically. By Desargues' theorem, the points A",B",C" lie on the perspectrix of the ktriangles T and T'.  Let Ka be the circle that passes through the points A,A',A'', and define Kb and Kc cyclically. As is well known, if P=X(1), then the circles Ka,Kb,Kc meet in X(15) and X(16), and their radical axis is the Brocard axis. We offer the following new observation. The locus of P such that Ka,Kb,Kc intersect in exactly two points, Z<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>2</sub>, is the curve Q066, which is the Stammler quartic (the isogonal image of the Stammler hyperbola). The curve Q066 passes through the excenters and the triangle centers X(k) for k=1, 2, 4, 254, and others, listed in
