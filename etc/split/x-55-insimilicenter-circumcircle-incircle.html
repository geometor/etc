Let A', B', C' be the second points of intersection of the angle bisectors of triangle ABC with its incircle.  Let Oa be the circle externally tangent to the incircle at A', and internally tangent to the circumcircle; define Ob and Oc cyclically.  Then X(55) is the radical center of circles Oa, Ob, Oc.  Let A&Prime; be the touchpoint of Oa and the circumcircle, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.  The lines A'A&Prime;, B'B&Prime;, C'C&Prime; concur in X(55).  Let Ba, Ca be the intersections of lines CA, AB, respectively, and the antiparallel to BC through a point P.  Define Cb, Ab, Ac, Bc cyclically.  Triangles ABaCa, AbBCb, AcBcC are congruent only when P = X(55) or one of its 3 extraversions.  Let A*B*C* be the incentral triangle.  Let La be the reflection of line BC in line AA*, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A''' = Lb&cap;Lc, and define B''' and C'''.  The lines A*A''', B*B''', C*C''' concur in X(55).

Let A'B'C' be the extouch triangle.  Let A&Prime; be the barycentric product of the circumcircle intercepts of line B'C', and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.  The lines AA&Prime;, BB&Prime;, CC&Prime; concur in X(55). (Randy Hutson, July 31 2018)
