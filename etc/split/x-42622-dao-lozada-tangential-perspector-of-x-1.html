Let ABC be an acute triangle with circumcircle &Omega; and P a finite point not on &Omega;. Denote as {{a'}}, {{b'}}, {{c'}} the circles {{B, C, P}}, {{C, A, P}}, {{A, B, P}}, respectively. Also, denote {{a"}} the circle internally tangent to &Omega; and externally tangent to {{b'}} and {{c'}} and let A" be its center. Define {{b"}}, {{c"}}, B", C" cyclically. Let T<sub>a</sub>, T<sub>b</sub>, T<sub>c</sub> be the touchpoints of &Omega; and {{a"}}, {{b"}} and {{c"}}, respectively. Then the lines AT<sub>a</sub>, BT<sub>b</sub>, CT<sub>c</sub> concur at a point Z'(P).</i> (Dao Thanh Oai, April 10, 2021)

If P = u : v : w (exact trilinears), then  Z'(P) = S*u*&rho;(A)+a*R*(u^2-v*w*cos(A)+w*u*cos(B)+u*v*cos(C)) : : , where &rho;(A) is the radius of {{a'}}. Z'(P) is named here the <b>Dao-Lozada tangential perspector of P</b>.</p>
<p>The appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that Z'(X(i))=X(j): (1, 42622), (3, 55), (4, 25), (13, 42623), (14, 42624), (15, 6)

Dao Thanh Oai also conjectured that triangles ABC and A"B"C" are perspective with perspector Z"(P). Although this conjecture has not been proved yet, the appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that Z"(X(i))=X(j): (1, 1130), (3, 35), (4, 4), (15, 61).
