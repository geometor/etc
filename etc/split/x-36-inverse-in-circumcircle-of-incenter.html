Let A' be the isogonal conjugate of A with respect to BCX(1), and define B' and C' cyclically.  Let A&Prime; be the circumcenter of BCX(1), and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.  The lines A'A&Prime;, B'B&Prime;, C'C&Prime; concur in X(36).  Also,
X(36) is the QA-P4 center (Isogonal Center) of quadrangle ABCX(1) (see http://www.chrisvantienhoven.nl/quadrangle-objects/15-mathematics/quadrangle-objects/artikelen-qa/25-qa-p4.html)

Let P be a point in the plane of triangle ABC, not on a sideline of ABC.  Let A1 be the isogonal conjugate of A with respect to triangle BCP, and define B1, C1 cyclically.  Call triangle A1B1C1 the 1st isogonal triangle of P.  A1B1C1 is also the reflection triangle of the isogonal conjugate of P.  A1B1C1 is perspective to ABC iff P lies on the Neuberg cubic.  The perspector lies on cubic K060 (pK(X1989, X265), O(X5) orthopivotal cubic).  Let A2 be the isogonal conjugate of A1 with respect to triangle B1C1P, and define B2, C2 cyclically.  Call triangle A2B2C2 the 2nd isogonal triangle of P.  Continuing, let An be the isogonal conjugate of A(n-1) with respect to triangle B(n-1)C(n-1)P, and define B(n), C(n) cyclically.  Call triangle AnBnCn the nth isogonal triangle of P.  For n &gt;= 2, all triangles AnBnCn are perspective to A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1).  Call the perspector, Pn, the nth isogonal perspector of P.  Pn is the orthocenter of A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1) and either the incenter or an excenter of AnBnCn.  The triangles AnBnCn are all concyclic, with P as center.  Call the circle the isogonal circle of P.  For P = X(1), the 2nd isogonal triangle of X(1) is homothetic to ABC at X(36); see also X(35), X(1478), X(1479), X(3583), X(3585), X(5903), X(7741), X(7951).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)
