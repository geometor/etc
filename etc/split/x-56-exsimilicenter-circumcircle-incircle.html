Let A'B'C' be the Fuhrmann triangle.  Let La be the line through A' parallel to BC, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A&Prime; = Lb&cap;Lc, B&Prime; = Lc&cap;La, C&Prime; = La&cap;Lb.  The lines AA&Prime;, BB&Prime;, CC&Prime; concur in X(56).  Also, let AaBaCa be the poristic triangle (i.e., a triangle with common circumcircle and incircle as ABC) such that BaCa is parallel to BC.  Define AbBbCb and AcBcCc cyclically.  The lines AAa, BBb, CCc concur in X(56).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)
