**Barycentrics**

:math:`sec A : sec B : sec C`

**Notes**

Let LA be the :term:`line <line>` through :ref:`X(4) <X(4)>` parallel to the internal bisector of angle A, and let A' = BC&cap;LA. Define B' and C' cyclically.

Alexei Myakishev, "The M-Configuration of a Triangle," Forum Geometricorum 3 (2003) 135-144,

proves that the lines AA', BB', CC' concur in :ref:`X(92) <X(92)>`. He notes that another construction follows from Proposition 2 of the article: let A1 be the midpoint of the arc BC of the circumcircle that passes through A, and let A2 be the :term:`point <point>`, other than A, in which the A-altitude meets the circumcircle. Let A&Prime; = A1A2&cap;BC. Define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically. Then the lines AA&Prime;, BB&Prime;, CC&Prime; concur in :ref:`X(92) <X(92)>`.

Suppose that T = A'B'C' is a :term:`central triangle <central triangle>`. Let A'' be the pole with respect to the :term:`polar <polar>` circle of the :term:`line <line>` B'C', and define B'' and C'' cyclically. The appearance of T in the following list means that the lines AA'', BB'', CC'' concur in :ref:`X(92) <X(92)>`: Feurerbach, incentral, excentral, extangents, Apollonius, mixtilinear excentral.
