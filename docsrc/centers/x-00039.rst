**Notes**

:ref:`X(39) <X(39)>` is the midpoint of the 1st and 2nd Brocard points, given by trilinears c/b : a/c : b/a and b/c : c/a : a/b. The third and fourth trilinear representations were given by Peter J. C. Moses (10/3/03); cf. :ref:`X(511) <X(511)>`, :ref:`X(32) <X(32)>`, :ref:`X(182) <X(182)>`.

The locus of the nine-:term:`point <point>` :term:`center <center>` in a Brocard porism (triangles sharing circumcircle and Brocard inellipse with ABC) is the circle through :ref:`X(5) <X(5)>` with :term:`center <center>` :ref:`X(39) <X(39)>`. (Randy Hutson, August 29, 2018)
