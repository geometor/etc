**Notes**

In the plane of a triangle ABC, let Ia = :term:`line <line>` through :ref:`X(3) <X(3)>` parallel to BC, and define Ib and Ic cyclically. Ac = Ia&cap;AB, and define Ba and Cb cyclically. Ab = Ia&cap;AC, and define Bc and Ca cyclically. Oa = circumcircle of A, Bc, Cb, and define Ob and Oc cyclically. Then 

:ref:`X(97) <X(97)>` = radical :term:`center <center>` of Oa, Ob, Oc. See also :ref:`X(77) <X(77)>`. (Ivan Pavlov, April 1, 2022)
