Let A' be the :term:`isogonal conjugate <isogonal conjugate>` of A with respect to BC:ref:`X(1) <X(1)>`, and define B' and C' cyclically. Let A&Prime; be the circumcenter of BC:ref:`X(1) <X(1)>`, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically. The lines A'A&Prime;, B'B&Prime;, C'C&Prime; concur in :ref:`X(36) <X(36)>`. Also, :ref:`X(36) <X(36)>` is the QA-P4 :term:`center <center>` (Isogonal :term:`Center <center>`) of quadrangle ABC:ref:`X(1) <X(1)>` (see http://www.chrisvantienhoven.nl/quadrangle-objects/15-mathematics/quadrangle-objects/artikelen-qa/25-qa-p4.html)

Let P be a :term:`point <point>` in the plane of triangle ABC, not on a sideline of ABC. Let A1 be the :term:`isogonal conjugate <isogonal conjugate>` of A with respect to triangle BCP, and define B1, C1 cyclically. Call triangle A1B1C1 the 1st isogonal triangle of P. A1B1C1 is also the reflection triangle of the :term:`isogonal conjugate <isogonal conjugate>` of P. A1B1C1 is :term:`perspective <perspective>` to ABC iff P lies on the Neuberg :term:`cubic <cubic>`. The perspector lies on :term:`cubic <cubic>` K060 (pK(X1989, X265), O(X5) orthopivotal :term:`cubic <cubic>`). Let A2 be the :term:`isogonal conjugate <isogonal conjugate>` of A1 with respect to triangle B1C1P, and define B2, C2 cyclically. Call triangle A2B2C2 the 2nd isogonal triangle of P. Continuing, let An be the :term:`isogonal conjugate <isogonal conjugate>` of A(n-1) with respect to triangle B(n-1)C(n-1)P, and define B(n), C(n) cyclically. Call triangle AnBnCn the nth isogonal triangle of P. For n &gt;= 2, all triangles AnBnCn are :term:`perspective <perspective>` to A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1). Call the perspector, Pn, the nth isogonal perspector of P. Pn is the orthocenter of A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1) and either the incenter or an excenter of AnBnCn. The triangles AnBnCn are all concyclic, with P as :term:`center <center>`. Call the circle the isogonal circle of P. For P = :ref:`X(1) <X(1)>`, the 2nd isogonal triangle of :ref:`X(1) <X(1)>` is homothetic to ABC at :ref:`X(36) <X(36)>`; see also :ref:`X(35) <X(35)>`, :ref:`X(1478) <X(1478)>`, :ref:`X(1479) <X(1479)>`, :ref:`X(3583) <X(3583)>`, :ref:`X(3585) <X(3585)>`, :ref:`X(5903) <X(5903)>`, :ref:`X(7741) <X(7741)>`, :ref:`X(7951) <X(7951)>`.

Let A'B'C' be the incentral triangle. Let A&Prime; be the reflection of A in :term:`line <line>` B'C', and define B&Prime;, C&Prime; cyclically. The lines A'A&Prime;, B'B&Prime;, C'C&Prime; concur in :ref:`X(36) <X(36)>`. (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
