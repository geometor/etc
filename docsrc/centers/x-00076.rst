**Notes**

Let A' be the perspector of the A-McCay circle, and define B' and C' cyclically. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in :ref:`X(76) <X(76)>`. (Randy Hutson, April 9, 2016)

:ref:`X(76) <X(76)>` is the :term:`vertex conjugate <vertex conjugate>` of the foci of the inellipse that is the barycentric square of the de Longchamps :term:`line <line>`. The :term:`center <center>` of the inellipse is :ref:`X(626) <X(626)>` and its Brianchon :term:`point <point>` (perspector) is :ref:`X(1502) <X(1502)>`. (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)

Let A'B'C' be the obverse triangle of :ref:`X(1) <X(1)>`. Let A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; be the N-obverse triangle of :ref:`X(1) <X(1)>`. Let A* be the barycentric product A'*A&Prime;, and define B* and C* cyclically. The lines AA*, BB*, CC* concur in :ref:`X(76) <X(76)>`. (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)

:ref:`X(76) <X(76)>` is the barycentric multiplier for the Steiner circumellipse. (The barycentric product of :ref:`X(76) <X(76)>` and the circumcircle is the Steiner circumellipse.) (Randy Hutson, August 19, 2019)
