**Notes**

:ref:`X(6) <X(6)>` is the :term:`point <point>` of concurrence of the symmedians (i.e., reflections of medians in corresponding angle bisectors). :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>` is the :term:`point <point>` which, when given by actual trilinear distances x,y,z, minimizes x2 + y2 + z2.

:ref:`X(6) <X(6)>` in Navigation: A talk about the symmedian :term:`point <point>`, by William Lionheart.

:ref:`X(6) <X(6)>` and other triangle centers play a fundamental part in Yuri I. Loginov's "Energy methods for single-position passive radar based on special points of a triangle", downloadable in Russian or as an English translation.

If you have The Geometer's Sketchpad, you can view Symmedian :term:`point <point>`. If you have GeoGebra, you can view Symmedian :term:`point <point>`.

Let A'B'C' be the pedal triangle of an arbitrary :term:`point <point>` X, and let S(X) be the vector sum XA' + XB' + XC'. Then

S(X) = (0 vector) if and only if X = :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>`.

The "if" implication is equivalent to the well known fact that :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>` is the centroid of its pedal triangle, and the converse was proved by Barry Wolk (Hyacinthos #19, Dec. 23, 1999).

Let P and Q be distinct points in a plane, and let T be a triangle rigidly rotating about P. Let X be a :term:`triangle center <triangle center>`, and let XT = X-of-T; O = a circle with :term:`center <center>` Q'; {A,B,C} = vertices of T; A' = inverse of A in O, and define B' and C' cyclically; T' = A'B'C'; X'T = X-of-T'. (1) If X = X(k) for k = 3, 6, 15, 16, 61, 62, then the locus of X'T is a conic. (2) If X = :ref:`X(15) <X(15)>` or X = :ref:`X(16) <X(16)>`, the conic is a circle. (3) If P is one of the points X(k), for k = 3, 6, 15, 16, 61, 62, then the locus of X'T is a single :term:`point <point>`, and the points O, XT, X'T are collinear. For example, if P = :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>`, then the locus of :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>`-of-T' is collinear with O and :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>`-of-T.

Let &Gamma; denote the circumcircle. The :term:`trilinear polar <trilinear polar>` of every :term:`point <point>` on &Gamma; passes through :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>`; conversely, the :term:`trilinear pole <trilinear pole>` of every :term:`line <line>` through :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>` lies on &Gamma;. The :term:`trilinear polar <trilinear polar>` of every :term:`point <point>` on the Lemoine axis (the :term:`polar <polar>` of :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>` with respect to &Gamma;) is a :term:`line <line>` tangent to the Brocard inellipse; conversely, the :term:`trilinear pole <trilinear pole>` of every :term:`line <line>` tangent to the Brocard inellipse lies on the Lemoine axis.

Let P be a :term:`point <point>` in the plane of T = ABC, and let T'=A'B'C' be the :term:`cevian triangle <cevian triangle>` of P. Let A'' = BC&cap;B'C', and define B'' and C'' cycllically. By Desargues' theorem, the points A",B",C" lie on the perspectrix of the ktriangles T and T'. Let Ka be the circle that passes through the points A,A',A'', and define Kb and Kc cyclically. As is well known, if P=:ref:`X(1) <X(1)>`, then the circles Ka,Kb,Kc meet in :ref:`X(15) <X(15)>` and :ref:`X(16) <X(16)>`, and their radical axis is the Brocard axis. We offer the following new observation. The locus of P such that Ka,Kb,Kc intersect in exactly two points, Z1 and Z2, is the curve Q066, which is the Stammler quartic (the isogonal image of the Stammler hyperbola). The curve Q066 passes through the excenters and the triangle centers X(k) for k=1, 2, 4, 254, and others, listed in Q066, Stammler quartic) . Moreover, the :term:`line <line>` Z1Z2 passes through the :term:`point <point>` :ref:`X(6) <X(6)>`-of-T. See the figures in Q066 and :term:`line <line>` Z1Z2 .
