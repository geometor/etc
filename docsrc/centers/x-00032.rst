The 5th Brocard triangle is here introduced as the vertex triangle of the circumcevian triangles of the 1st and 2nd Brocard points. (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2015)

The 5th Brocard triangle is homothetic to ABC at :ref:`X(32) <X(32)>`, homothetic to the medial triangle at :ref:`X(3096) <X(3096)>`, homothetic to the :term:`anticomplementary triangle <anticomplementary triangle>` at :ref:`X(2896) <X(2896)>`, :term:`perspective <perspective>` to the 1st Brocard triangle at :ref:`X(2896) <X(2896)>`, and :term:`perspective <perspective>` to the 3rd Brocard triangle at :ref:`X(32) <X(32)>`.(Randy Hutson, December 26, 2015)

Let A'B'C' be the 1st Brocard triangle. Let A&Prime;, B&Prime;, C&Prime; be inverse-in-circumcircle of A', B' and C' resp. AA&Prime;, BB&Prime;, CC&Prime; concur in :ref:`X(32) <X(32)>`. (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)

Let A'B'C' be the 1st Brocard triangle. Let A&Prime; be the :term:`cevapoint <cevapoint>`, wrt A'B'C', of B and C, and define B&Prime;, C&Prime; cyclically. A'A&Prime;, B'B&Prime;, C'C&Prime; concur in :ref:`X(32) <X(32)>`. (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)
